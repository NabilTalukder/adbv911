    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Shooting Asteroids</h3>
    <p>This is the first project I programmed to demonstrate my knowledge at the end of Coding Bootcamp at City. It was created in Processing, demonstrating an understanding of object-oriented programming , arrays, loops, randomness and user input. Asteroids are represented by circles, drawn using a for loop and an array list. They are removed from the list upon colliding with a projectile or reaching the bottom of the screen. The asteroids properties are randomly generated, including colour, size and velocity. Projectiles are stored similarly in an array list and are displayed onto the screen every time the mouse is clicked, with short delays in between to make the game more challenging. The player is represented by a rectangle and follows the coordinates of the mouse. Score is displayed in the top-left and increases depending on the size of the asteroid that is destroyed by the player.</p>

    <p>The code can be found on Github <a href="https://github.com/NabilTalukder/adbv911">https://github.com/NabilTalukder/adbv911</a>
